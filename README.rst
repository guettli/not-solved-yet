Things which are not solved yet
###############################


Python
======

Depedency Management. The tool pip works somehow, but a real dependency management is missing.


`Configuring the logging of a third party script <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29962525/configuring-the-logging-of-a-third-party-script>`_

Databases
=========

`Mathematical equality of two SQL statements <https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/96865/mathematical-equality-of-two-sql-statements>`_



Django
======

Web-GUI for installing apps. No editing of python files to install an app. Nextcloud is great here. You can upgrade from one version to the next via web gui. This is great.

Performance Analysis
====================

A tool like new relic (low overhead sampling profiler that collects call graphs for running production apps), but open source. 

Android Photo to Nextcloud
==========================

I take a picture with my android device. I would like to have it stored in my nextcould account "pictures" in this schema: 

    YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD

I want this to be done automatically without manual work.
